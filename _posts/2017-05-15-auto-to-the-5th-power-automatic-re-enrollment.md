Today I’m covering another facet of Auto to the 5th Power, automatic re-enrollment. You have can actually re-enroll your employees into that Qualified Default Investment Option, or QDIA, to provide incredible protection for you as a plan sponsor and help your employees save money to create that paycheck for life.

If you’d like to skip ahead and learn all the secrets on how to create the best possible retirement plan for yourself, I’d be happy to get you a copy of my book, “Save America, Save! The Secrets of a Successful 401(k) Plan.” I’d also like to get you a copy of my first book, “Paychecks for Life: How to Turn Your 401(k) into a Paycheck Manufacturing Company.” It contains my nine secret recipes for how your employees can create a paycheck for life.&nbsp;

Now onto our topic for today.

**Automatic re-enrollment** is the option where you send out a 30-day notice and tell people that if they do not want a change in their investment options, they need to let you know. Otherwise, there are going to be automatically re-enrolled into that QDIA investment option. Don’t forget, you as the employer are protected under the Pension Protection Act of 2008.
