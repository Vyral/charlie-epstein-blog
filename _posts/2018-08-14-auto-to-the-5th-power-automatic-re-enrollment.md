Today I’m covering another facet of Auto to the 5th Power, automatic re-enrollment. You have can actually re-enroll your employees into that Qualified Default Investment Option, or QDIA, to provide incredible protection for you as a plan sponsor and help your employees save money to create that paycheck for life.

Now onto our topic for today.

Automatic re-enrollment is the option where you send out a 30-day notice and tell people that if they do not want a change in their investment options, they need to let you know. Otherwise, there are going to be automatically re-enrolled into that QDIA investment option. Don’t forget, you as the employer are protected under the Pension Protection Act of 2008.

If you have any other questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
