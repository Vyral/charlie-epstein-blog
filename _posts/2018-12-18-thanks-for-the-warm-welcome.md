The end of the year in nigh, and at Epstein Financial Services, we have a lot to be grateful for, not the least of which is our new home in the heart of the thriving East Longmeadow business community.

Thank you to all who attended our recent celebration. It was a pleasure to be among friends both old and new to celebrate the next chapter of Epstein Financial Services as we settle into our new location.

We were also excited to offer a special tasting of the new “Desirement Coffee” that Currency Coffee created for us—a special blend you can enjoy anytime you visit.

## Happy to Be in the Heart of East Longmeadow

Our welcome from the local business community has been a warm one. We were delighted to have the opportunity to showcase our new space, have great conversations and learn about ways we can support each other.

A special thank you goes out to Center Square Grill for their delicious fare, and to my friend Robert Charles who captured some beautiful memories from the evening. [Click here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/02e1rrr00tjut03/AABICi05fj0vZPzkStXe6L8Va?dl=0--){: target="_blank"} to see more photos.

## More to Come

I’m grateful to Ray Houle Construction and our subcontractors for doing such a fabulous renovation. Our new home gives us a lot more flexibility and room to grow. Our square footage has increased by 50 percent and includes a video studio that can be used to film promotional and educational videos for Epstein Financial Services, The 401k Coach® Program and clients’ businesses. We also have accessible parking, as well as larger conference and meeting spaces.

We’re excited for what 2019 holds, and we hope our clients are as well. If you need a road map to ensure your future success, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
