Today I want to focus on something I call “needs-based versus greeds-based” rate of return. Before getting into the details of this and why it’s so important, [I want to make sure that you have an opportunity to get my book “Save America, Save!: The Secrets of a Successful Retirement Plan.”](https://www.epsteinfinancial.com/free-book-offer.html) It’s chock-full of all of my secrets on how to turn your 401(k) into a successful retirement plan.

We are passionate about teaching employees how to create a paycheck for life and how to turn their 401(k) into a paycheck manufacturing company. But if I asked your employees how much they want to earn on the money they’re contributing to their retirement plan, do you know what they’d say to me? They’d say 10%, or even up to 50%!

In other words, **your employees’ greeds-based rate of return is an unrealistic number.** They actually believe that they’re going to get a 10 to 50% rate of return on their investment, year-in and year-out.

We’ve been in a nine-year bull market. There are employees in their 20's who have been contributing to their retirement plan that have never experienced a bear market, which is a drop of 20% more in their account value. **This is critical**. It’s also what I think makes the 401(k) plan America’s largest casino, because people are rolling the dice when it comes to their 401(k) plan’s rate of return.&nbsp;

Now, if I were to ask your employees, “Can you tell me what your needs-based rate of return is?”, the answer I’d get would be open-mouthed silence. **They don’t know what that is.**

**The needs-based rate of return is the single most important rate of return.** &nbsp;My own definition of what constitutes “needs-based” is what rate of return employees need to earn on their money, year-in and year-out, with the least amount of risk that will almost guarantee that they’ll have a paycheck for the rest of your life. &nbsp;It is critical that your employees calculate their needs-based rate of return today.

Since your employees don’t know what their needs-based rate of return is, **we have a calculator available called the Desirement Mortgage Calculator**. In my first book, “Paychecks For Life: How to Turn Your 401(k) Into a Paycheck Manufacturing Company,” I go into more detail about the Desirement Mortgage Calculator, which I will send to you by clicking the above link for a *free copy.&nbsp;*

Stay tuned for my next blog, where I talk about what I call a GAP Statement and how we show your employees how to project their investments and savings returns, how to identify their needs-based rate of return, and how to create that paycheck for life.&nbsp;
