  Do your employees have a realistic understanding of their own retirement plan?
  I’m here today to encourage them to calculate their needs-based rate of
  return, instead of their greeds-based.

Today I want to focus on something I call “needs-based versus greeds-based” rate of return. Before getting into the details of this and why it’s so important, however, I want to make sure that [you have an opportunity to get my book “Save America, Save!: The Secrets of a Successful Retirement Plan.”](https://www.epsteinfinancial.com/free-book-offer.html) It’s chock-full of all of my secrets on how to turn your 401(k) into a successful retirement plan.

We are passionate about teaching employees how to create a paycheck for life, and how to turn their 401(k) into a paycheck manufacturing company. But if I asked your employees how much they want to earn on the money they’re contributing to the retirement plan, do you know what they’d say to me? They’d say 10% up to even 50%!

In other words, **your employees’ greeds-based rate of return is an unrealistic number.**&nbsp;They actually believe, year-in and year-out, that they’re going to get a 10% to 50% rate of return on their investment.

We’ve been in a nine-year bull market. There are employees who have been contributing to their retirement plan in their 20s that have never experienced a bear market, which is a drop of 20% more in their account value. **This is critical.** It’s also what I think makes the 401(k) plan America’s largest casino, because people are rolling the dice when it comes to their returns.&nbsp;

Now, if I were to ask your employees, “Can you tell me what your needs-based rate of return is?”, the answer I’d get would be open-mouthed silence. **They don’t know what that is.**

**The needs-based rate of return is the single most important rate of return.** Your employees need to know what their needs-based rate of return is. My own definition of what constitutes “needs-based” is what return you need to earn on your money, year-in and year-out with the least amount of risk, that will almost guarantee that you will have a paycheck for the rest of your life.&nbsp;

Since your employees don’t know what their needs-based rate of return is, **we have a calculator available called the Desirement Mortgage Calculator**. In another blog entry, I’ll go into detail about the desirement mortgage calculator concept.&nbsp;

But we will tell your employees that it is critical that they have their needs-based rate of return calculated because today, more than ever, **people need to know what they need to earn on their money, year-in and year-out with the least amount of risk, that will guarantee that they will have a paycheck for the rest of their life.&nbsp;**I go into more details about that in my first book, “Paychecks For Life: How to Turn Your 401(k) Into a Paycheck Manufacturing Company,” which I also send you a copy of at the link mentioned earlier in this blog.&nbsp;

Stay tuned for my next blog, where I talk about what I call a gap statement and how we show your employees how to project out their investment and saving returns, how to identify their needs-based rate of return, and how to create that paycheck for life.&nbsp;
