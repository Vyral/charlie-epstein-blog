I’ve got some exciting news to share. This Saturday, December 24th, I am going to be a guest on The Western Mass Business Show with Ira Bryck. We are going to talk about how an “engaged purpose” drives everything that happens at Epstein Financial Services. We’ll also talk about how we bring light to all the things that need improvements for owners, employees, and customers. We hope you’ll join us on Saturday at 11 a.m. on WHMP AM 1400.
