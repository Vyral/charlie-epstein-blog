Today I’m going to give you the secret to turning your 401(k) plan into a paycheck manufacturing company. First, let’s imagine you have the best 401(k) plan possible. You might have that plan already.

**Creating this plan requires making all of your decisions in the best interests of your employees.** It also requires meeting on a quarterly basis with your advisor. You should have lots of investments that cost nothing. This sounds like the perfect retirement plan, but it’s not quite. Something is missing: your employees’ contributions. What can you do if they aren’t contributing enough to the plan to maximize its benefits and create those paychecks for life?

ERISA is the law that established the retirement plan industry in 1974. Before that, everything was a pension plan. Those pension plans would automatically generate an income for people for the rest of their lives. Pension plans don’t exist anymore. Even when your company is matching, you still have to contribute to your 401(k) to maximize its benefits.

**One important thing you should know about ERISA is the Exclusive Purpose Rule.** It states that if you’re a plan sponsor and establish a retirement plan for the benefit of your employees, you are doing it for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to them and their beneficiaries.

My next series of posts will focus on how you can help your employees become more engaged and excited in order to maximize their contributions toward their retirement plan to create that paycheck for life.
