I was recently a guest on Fox Business’s show “Countdown to the Closing Bell with Liz Claman” where I talked about the prospect of simpler banking regulations under the Trump administration. **Here’s a quick summary of what I talked about.**

Donald Trump has rolled back the Dodd-Frank act, which has constricted a lot of small banks in the past. In fact, I founded a small bank back in 2007 and Dodd-Frank strangled our ability to loan money to small businesses. **Small businesses make up 80% of this economy, and now they will be able to access capital much easier.** That’s good for jobs and growth.

When small banks were held to the same standards as the big banks, it didn’t work. However, does this mean all of the Dodd-Frank act should be torched?

WIth President Trump’s first action, Congress will have to get involved and trim down Dodd-Frank. However, the biggest piece is bureaucracy. **The notion that more regulation will prevent things from happening is wrong.** The free markets need to be free and they will determine what’s in the best interests of businesses and consumers. When the smaller banks are able to release that capital to smaller businesses, the results will be tremendous.
