In this series, we’ve been talking about how to get your employees engaged in saving for their retirement plan. Today’s topic is one of my favorites: something called “OPM.”

Perhaps you remember the movie “Other People’s Money”, starring Danny Devito. Well, **in the 401(k) plan, employees have the opportunity to capture other people’s money as well.**

The first thing that I like to talk about with employees is that, in their 401(k) plans, they actually have two partners that contribute money to their plan: Uncle Sam (the government), and you (their employer).

Let’s talk about Uncle Sam first. Follow along in the video for visual representations of these examples.

Suppose that Uncle Sam takes 20%, 30%, or 40% of your dollar every month. Here’s a critical question: Will they ever give it back?

The answer is no. You’re never going to get that money once Uncle Sam takes it from you.

You might be thinking that that’s not a lot of money. But here’s something to think about: Suppose that they just took one penny from that dollar. Imagine a chessboard with 30 squares, and **each day you move the penny one square over, and each time you move the penny, it doubles in value.** So the first day, it’d be one cent, two cents the next day, four cents the next day, and so on.<br><br>Here’s the multimillion-dollar question: If the value of that penny doubled with every square it moved each day, what will it be worth on the thirtieth square?

Your employees might give a range of answers from $3 to $300,000. In reality, **however, that penny would be worth $5,368,709.12.**That’s a lot of pennies.

What’s the point of this story? Well, first of all, we’re not guaranteeing that your money will double every day. It’s just a demonstration of the **power of compound interest.**

In other words, you have a choice: You can either put 70 cents of the original dollar we talked about in your pocket and pay for all the things you need to do, or you can put it into your retirement plan and let it grow compounded.

Let’s take a look at that. Instead of one dollar, let’s use $100 in this example, and let’s imagine that you’re in the 30% tax bracket. Uncle Sam comes along and says, “You can either put $70 in your pocket, or I’ll let you use the $30 (the 30%), provided that you put it in your 401(k) plan.”<br><br>If you do that, what’ll be the rate of return on your $70? It’s almost a 33.3% return.

Now let’s say your employer wants to invest in your future. They’ll match you 50 cents on the dollar on the first 6%. That means your employer is going to contribute $50 to your 401(k) plan, where you put in $70, and the government supplies $30.

In this example, what’s the rate of return on your $70? Well, it more than doubled to a 110% rate of return on your investment.

The point of this story is that it’s so critical for your employees that aren’t contributing up to the match or aren’t using Uncle Sam’s money to understand that **if they aren’t using other people’s money, they’re missing out on an enormous opportunity.**

These are the kinds of principles that we teach to employees—it’s not complicated. We want to help your employees, in simple language, figure out how much money they need to save, how to take advantage of other people’s money, and how to create that paycheck for life.

I want to give you a copy of my book “Paychecks for Life: How to Turn Your 401(K) Into a Paycheck Manufacturing Company.” If you’d like a copy or have any other questions about this topic, give me a call. Let us help you help your employees use other people’s money to compound interest and create that paycheck for life.
