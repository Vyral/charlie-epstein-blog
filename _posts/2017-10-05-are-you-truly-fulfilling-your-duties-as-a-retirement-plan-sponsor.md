There’s a lot of activity right now in the 401(k) industry, but today I want to talk specifically about a court case that has been dragging out for the past six or seven years: Tibble v. Edison.

In this case, the judge finally ruled that if you have a 401(k) plan, you’ve got a duty of prudence and loyalty to your participants. You must make sure to monitor your investment plans. With the correct process in place, you should be able to prudently choose investment for your employees.

In this case, which was over a $3 million plan, the sponsors’ fiduciaries had both institutional share mutual funds and retail share mutual funds.

But, what’s the difference between these? **An institutional mutual fund is the lowest cost fund that one can purchase from a carrier.** It also has no revenue sharing.

A retail mutual fund has higher fees. These fees compensate your broker advisor and also may cover other revenue sharing expenses.

The judge in Tibble v. Edison ultimately determined that the trustees failed their duty of loyalty and prudence. The employer in Tibble v. Edison used retail mutual funds with revenue sharing, resulting in more expensive funds for the employees  According to the judge, **they were accountable to either know or ask if there was a cheaper share class they could have purchased**and provided to their employees.

The employer very well could have used institutional funds that were less expensive and lacked revenue sharing. In the end, the employer ended up having to pay dearly for failing in their duty of prudence.

As a plan sponsor it’s important that you understand all the fees in your plan, so that you can make prudent decisions in the best interests of your employees.
