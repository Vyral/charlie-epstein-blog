Today, we’re going to focus on what I call “the Gap Statement.”

Recently, we’ve been talking a lot about employee engagement. If you aren’t taking advantage of the Retirement Gap Analysis Report, however,&nbsp;**you aren’t helping your employees to the fullest extent.**

This report specifically tells your employees what they need to save for retirement based on their needs-based rate of return, which is the least amount of risk they need to take to achieve a near-guaranteed paycheck for the rest of their life.

In other words: What is the return your employees need to earn with the least amount of risk?

Now, the Gap Statement will show your employees how much of a monthly income they’re going to have when they reach their retirement years. It’ll consider a number of things, and will&nbsp;**then show them the gap between their current monthly income and what they need to live on.**

It will also show how much more monthly income employees can have if they gradually increase their savings rate. This monthly income has a lot to do with something called the income replacement ratio which I will discuss further in a future video.

This report will not only tell employees how much they’ll be saving toward retirement, but also how much they’ll save in terms of taxes.

**Ultimately, the net cost for them to increase their contributions may not be as much as they think.**
